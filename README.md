# d3-cartogram

This is a JavaScript implementation of [an algoritm to construct continuous area cartograms](http://chrisman.scg.ulaval.ca/G360/dougenik.pdf), by James A. Dougenik, Nicholas R. Chrisman and Duane R. Niemeyer, Â©1985 by the Association of American Geographers. It relies heavily on [d3](http://github.com/mbostock/d3) for rendering and [TopoJSON](http://github.com/mbostock/topojson) both for writing and reading topological JSON geodata.

The [included example](http://alexpreynolds.github.io/d3-cartogram/?segmentized#popest/2011) combines TopoJSON-encoded and boundaries of the United States from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/) with [2011 US Census population estimates](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/) to size each state proportionally.

I include small modifications to how states and Washington DC are colored, which use a lookup table for the state of same-sex marriage laws in the United States as of May 19, 2014 (http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/where-state-laws-stand).
